# ViT-MNIST: Visual Transformer for Handwritten Digit Classification

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for the classification of handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**. The project demonstrates the use of transformer architectures, originally designed for natural language processing, in the domain of computer vision.

##  Vision Transformer (ViT):
The **Vision Transformer (ViT)** is a deep learning model that applies the principles of transformers, which are highly successful in natural language processing, to image data. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT divides an image into patches and processes them as a sequence of tokens using self-attention mechanisms. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between different parts of the image.

### Key Features of ViT:
- Breaks down input images into fixed-size patches.
- Uses positional embeddings to maintain spatial information.
- Applies multi-head self-attention to process and classify images.

## What is the MNIST Dataset?
The **MNIST dataset** is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), where each image is 28x28 pixels in size.

### Dataset Details:
- **Training Set:** 60,000 images
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images
- **Classes:** 10 (digits from 0 to 9)

The dataset is commonly used for tasks such as image classification, model benchmarking, and as a starting point for deep learning experiments.
